This is a Spring Boot REST API Iâ€™m building to manage products and users in an inventory system.
It supports JWT authentication, role-based access control, and CRUD operations for products.

Right now itâ€™s fully functional, but Iâ€™ll keep improving it over time.

---

#### Features (So Far)
*  User Authentication with JWT (Register & Login).

* Role-based access control (User vs Admin).

* Product Management (CRUD):

  * Create products

   * Update product details

    * Delete products

    * Get product by ID

* User Management (Admin only):

  * View all users

  * Get a user by username

  * Delete a user

### Future Plans

Iâ€™m not done yet hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ll add next:

*  Pagination & sorting for product listings

* Timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) for products

* Docker & Docker Compose (with Postgres)

* Deploy online (Railway/Render/Heroku) for live demo

* Analytics dashboard (product stock levels, sales trends, etc.)

### Environment Variable

This project use a '.env' file to store configuration values the database, there is a template named "envtemplate.env.example" showing you exactly how it should look like.

Create a '.env' file in the **project root**:

```env

DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/InventoryAPI

DB_USERNAME=yourusername 

DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
---


### Database Configuration

- This project uses PostgreSQl.

      1. Go to your .env file in your project root. 
      2. Configure the database details to your custom details.
      3. Go to Run -> Edit Connfiguration -> Environment Variables
      4. Enable your .env file ( use the EnvFile plugin)

- Steps to set up the database:

  - Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running.

  - Create the database:

    - CREATE DATABASE inventoryAPI;
    - Update the username and password in application.properties to your own.
    - When you run the Spring Boot app, JPA/Hibernate will automatically create/update tables.

### Admin Seeding

- Admin User (Seeded on Runtime)
  - For testing and management purposes, the application automatically creates and admin user when applications starts. This ensures that theres always at least one admin present.

  - Credentials:
    ```json
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "admin123"
    }


### How to Use (For Now)

1) Clone the repo

- git clone https://github.com/NatePombi/inventory-management-system-api


2) Navigate into the project

- cd inventory-management-system-api


3) Run the project

- ./mvnw spring-boot:run


4) Open Swagger docs in browser:

- http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
